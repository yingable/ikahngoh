                            <p>Copying and pasting the write up from Iowa cold case awesome site! BUCKLE UP ITS A LONG BUMPY RIDE! https://iowacoldcases.org/case-summaries/donna-sue-davis/ (https://iowacoldcases.org/case-summaries/donna-sue-davis/) Donna Sue Davis hadn’t yet reached her second birthday. The 21-month-old 21-pound blue-eyed girl with the mass of dark blond curly hair was the youngest of James (“Don”) and Mary Davis’s three children, and her three prized possessions included. O. The house had brackets on the archway that led to the front door. It was clear that the last family who had owned the house that they were of Greek origin. You know the sort, those plastic brackets that spread out in various patterns. They were signature decorations of every Greek family and Melbourne had its fair share of Greek families. Apart from Greece itself, Melbourne was populated with more Greek families than anywhere else in the world. The archway led up to the front n : https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6yzo54/fluffy_part_2_or_this_is_why_your_cat_hates_you/ First time poster, thought I’d throw my hat in the ring. Language is a little blue in places, fair warning on that front.

A nauseous wave crested deep within my bowels and roared up my spine, blossoming frothy spray through my brain like the malignant antithesis of an orgasm. Simon had lied to me. Oh, he hadn’t technically lied to me; in his Machiavellian Faerie way, he had told the precise truth. The baby would not be killed and eaten, but neither would. ### Previously (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/8cbdd2/roleplay_crime_and_punishment_the_anglish_legal/) ##Darkplace Chapter 2 Episode 3 Outside Darkplace Courthouse Jimmy Wilson had been doing the rounds in Darkplace since his abrupt departure from Fernando’s, Mystic Brian’s ice-cream parlour on the high street, which had come about as a result of his great disdain for the comings and goings of Dale ‘Mac’ MacLachlan, who he regarded as a chipper globalist stooge, an assessm. For a girl who had spent all her life in the cold, damp rainforest that was British Columbia, South America was another world altogether. "Isn't this beautiful, Bethany?" said Manuela. She was stretched out on a bright yellow beach towel, wearing a tiny black bikini and oversized sunglasses. Her wavy black hair was tied in a loose bun at the nape of her neck, and her smooth olive skin glistened with the tanning oil she'd rubbed all over her body. "It's gorgeous," I said, squeezing another. It was a most uncommon day, that day in September that the visions I began to experience simply became so very convincing that I knew they must be reality. Henceforth, I knew that my life was different from others’, and that I could see things that others would never be able to fathom. Only I could enjoy the fruitful pleasures of my wondrous journey through life as I knew it from then on. The Devil had tempted me, and I accepted my fate as a Hell-child. I, however, cannot begin telling.

I don't really have anybody to talk to about it as my family knows what she does, yet excuses or forgives her behavior, and my friends don't need to be saddled with this. I would just like to vent this and enjoy a good night's sleep and then move on with trying to be awesome.

The farmer examined his apple trees. They were withered. Rain that never came teased him now, dabbling his face. But the growing season was over. The crop had failed. Knobby little apples hung from limp branches, the acuity of their thirst long since passed as they had shriveled into hardened corpuscles of seeds, preserving their contents in resignation.

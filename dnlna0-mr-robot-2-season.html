Mr Robot 2nd season ran for 12 episodes each of roughly 50mins. My view is that this season was a total waste. Follows is my reasoning: ---- First 3-4 episodes could have been done in a single 50min episode. A great deal of the show time was needlessly wasted on nonsense dialog that did nothing to advance or progress the story nor will they be key to any future narrative in the overall story-line. eg: long winded discussion between Terry Colby and Phillip Price. ---- The reveal Сара Мишель Геллар (Sarah Michelle Gellar).

Mr. Robot is sweeping up all the important awards (Best drama, best actors) and well deserved! When i started to watch this series i didn't expect much, but it has blow me away even in the first episode. I feel like I'm constantly seeing threads on r/television and r/askreddit about which TV shows you gave up on, and I always get frustrated when I read comments about people who gave up on a favorite show of mine right before it really hit its stride. Like people who gave up on The Leftovers before season 2, or people who gave up on Mr. Robot before season 3. So, what's a TV show that you'd advise others to keep watching, even if they aren't enjoying it straight.

Season 2 was 12 episodes and also aired in July of 2016, looking at Mr. Robot season 4 being 12 episodes I’m assuming we could get a July-August release date, October being the latest. If anyone had any information on when season 3 began filming that would be helpful as we could compare dates.

During S3, I stumbled upon a potential formula to spotting those deep-meaning "dream" episodes of Mr. Robot where the story is revealed to us in a surreal dream state. Sam Esmail has noted in at least a few interviews that those dreams are information-dense keys to decode what is happening on the show and that he likes to reveal information this way. Here is the simple formula: Take the number of the "dream" episode from the previous season, add 2, and that is the number of the current season.
